# loveletter for my copiers! (you Linda.)

 so hi! i'm honestly so confused like how do you copy a skin and YET still make mistakes?? Anyway my copier callouts ;) <3
since they didn't ask for permission, i don't need their permission back to expose their accounts! <3

### So, case n.o 1! (code for code?? seriously? at least tint it)

**IN JANUARY on Safe server (Global) 18/01/2024 19:12**, a random pony 'H', lo and behold, their account is 'Linda'! I hope you got banned after you got reported the other time Linda! I know I won't miss you, but i wish you understood English more so i could properly berate you in public! And, please improve your grammar, its honestly embarrassing.

Like you chose to whisper and expose yourself that you copied me, and i managed to mark you like.. you're literally lacking so much common sense i'm wondering if you even grew up with your head screwed on right. You even made the *EASIEST mistake*, after all the steps you DELIBERATELY took to hide my friends and deciding to confront me, **BY showing up IN FRONT of me** ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

**ANDDD YOU CHOSE TO WAIT FOR ME TO COME BACK FROM MY AFK STATUS TOO ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ for like 10 minutes**

BTW i think its OBVIOUS who 'H' is. spoiler alert! it's the pony with the black hair and red tie

##and WHISPERING to negotiate?

oh please! if you want to negotiate you can shove your printing skills up your guts through your fecal point, or i can do it for you! i can even throw in exposing your IP address if you'd like! or i can put in the pictures for my characters of course, to the all-fulfilling library known as PINTEREST.

anyway, more photoshoots of Linda using MY Dainsleif skin ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ AND updating it after i caught them in my NEW Dainsleif skin
and like, please, **SPELL right.** its oftb for 'OFFTAB' meaning i'm literally not on the PonyTown tab chronically like you, not 'ofto' for 'originality fucking thrown out'. did you even pass kindergarten or nursery? i think you should head back in, though you might get rejected!

and i can't believe you have the utter AUDIACITY to return and hang around where i usually sit too at the tree in the Genshin Hoyoverse Area LMAOOOO, you really want to take my skin? or are you just trying your best to even get in a mere fraction of what i can do with MY art skills?
Even cockroaches know not to return to a place of danger in a household

##### AND, the reason why i put sick nvb (meaning NON-VERBAL) in my title,
was because i had **Covid** during that period! dumbass! i hope you get covid too, you uneducated dimwitted lifeform!

### Linda spotted again on  â€” 26/02/2024 22:17
more of Linda's skins!
Copying an Alhaitham.. really..? I saw the OG skin in September about how someone copied their Alhaitham like girl! if that was you, your copying tendency is too far long gone to be cured

![Linda's pinterest Alhaitham skin!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1200784385121730601/1231217677264228403/image.png?ex=6653d191&is=66528011&hm=9f46cb0f51efd771d95cbe19602d861ad80d9105d5f04ae98f61635f99182504&)

### also again on â€” 26/02/2024 22:35
And some furry skin :skull:, you're seriously giving 'copiers' a bad name, like just quit, whats the point if all you can even do is even **FAIL at copying**

![Linda's furry japanese skin!!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1200784385121730601/1211950593904476200/image.png?ex=66539932&is=665247b2&hm=2a7effa10096a2a1597a2a67059197b960c342e3ecbfc0e6d58fb65fc0580112&) 

### case n.o 2 or maybe its still Linda

Hi Linda! if its you again, what's literally your deal LMAOOO
This is **LITERALLY** an OC *(original character)* like, can you even tell me whats my OC's name? you can't, *can you?* can you tell me what species he is? **you can't,** ***can you?***

actually i shouldn't assume you even understand the BARE MINIMUM of not copying an ORIGINAL idea since you're lacking so much common knowledge and sense to even ASK for permission!

i swear if this is your alt, its honestly pathetic how you're choosing to continuously come after me for skin ideas LMAOO

#### like this was literally last night around 10pm+   â€” 19/04/2024 22:32

and like.. CODE FOR CODE AGAIN??
